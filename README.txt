To make the program work you need to:
  1. write the frase you want wirght to say
  2. choose the animation and write it's name with the .gif (it's case sensitive
P.S. i also added a gif and the courtroom background, if you want to change that you just need to change the " bg = pyglet.image.load('courtroom.png') "
